#GoalLateral
This is a solo project I completed as a student at [Hack Reactor](http://hackreactor.com) over a 48hr period.
In that time span, I planned, implemented, and presented my MVP for this app. It's still a work in progress, but was a lot of fun to use and explore technologies such as firebase, angular, and OAuth.
